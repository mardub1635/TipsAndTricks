@article{Dunn2013a,
abstract = {This paper argues that two properties of the linguistic structure of an utterance influence and partially determine whether the utterance has a metaphoric meaning that results in a stable interpretation: (i) degree of metaphoricity and (ii) degree of metaphoric saturation. A majority of metaphoric utterances in a corpus study (66{\%}) were unsaturated, low metaphoricity utterances that behave as expected by Max Black and the cognitive linguistics paradigm. However, a significant minority (34{\%}) of the metaphoric utterances were saturated or high metaphoricity utterances that behave partially as expected by Donald Davidson and others working in his tradition. This suggests that the direct and indirect interpretation views of metaphor are not incompatible but apply to different sub-groups of metaphoric utterances. The paper then constructs a model of metaphoric meaning that makes falsifiable predictions about the interpretations of metaphoric utterances in order to provide further evidence that unsaturated, low metaphoricity utterances have stable interpretations. This research provides both converging evidence for the cognitive linguistic view of metaphor and also a framework for limiting its scope to most, but not all, metaphoric utterances.},

@article{Gibbs2002,
abstract = {What role does literal meaning play in language comprehension? This question has been vigorously debated in research on figurative language understanding. The standard pragmatic view proposes that people must analyze the complete literal meaning of indirect and figurative utterances before pragmatic information is consulted to infer speakers' nonliteral messages. Most of the psycholinguistic research shows, however, that given sufficient context people understand nonliteralmeanings without first analyzing the complete literal meaning of an expression (i.e., the direct access view). Several lines of research have recently attempted to demonstrate that people still analyze aspects of literal meaning when understanding metaphors, irony, idioms, and proverbs. I critically evaluate this new work and suggest that it does not contribute sufficient evidence against the direct access view. Nonetheless, I argue that other research suggests how people analyze aspects of what speakers say as part of inferring what speakers implicate. This conclusion has several implications for specifying the role of pragmatics in ordinary utterance interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {CorMet is a corpus-based system for discovering metaphorical mappings between concepts. It does this by nding systematic variations in domain-specic selectional preferences, which are inferred from large, dynamicallymined Internet corpora. Metaphors transfer structure from a source domainto a target domain,making some concepts in the target domain metaphorically equivalent to concepts in the source domain. The verbs that select for a concept in the source domain tend to select for its metaphorical equivalent in the target domain. This regularity, detectable with a shallow linguistic analysis, is used to nd the metaphorical interconcept mappings,which can then be used to infer the existence of higher-level conventional metaphors. Most other computational metaphor systemsusesmall,hand-codedsemantic knowledge bases and workona fewexamples.AlthoughCorMets only knowledgebase isWordNet (Fellbaum1998) it can nd the mappings constituting many conventional metaphors and in some cases recognize sentences instantiating those mappings.

abstract = {This paper examines patterns of metaphor in usage. Four samples of text excerpts of on average 47,000 words each were taken from the British National Corpus and annotated for metaphor. The linguistic metaphor data were collected by five analysts on the basis of a highly explicit identification procedure that is a variant of the approach developed by the Pragglejaz Group (2007). Part of this paper is a report of the protocol and the reliability of the procedure. Data analysis shows that, on average, one in every seven and a half lexical units in the corpus is related to metaphor defined as a potential cross-domain mapping in conceptual structure. It also appears that the bulk of the expression of metaphor in discourse consists of non-signalled metaphorically used words, not similes. The distribution of metaphor-related words, finally, turns out to be quite variable between the four registers examined in this study: academic texts have 18.5{\%}, news 16.4{\%}, fiction 11.7{\%}, and conversation 7.7{\%}. The systematic comparative investigation of these registers raises new questions about the relation between cognitive linguistic and other approaches to metaphor.},

abstract = {Research on the neuronal underpinnings of speaker identity recognition has identified voice-selective areas in the human brain with evolutionary homologues in non-human primates who have comparable areas for processing species-specific calls. Most studies have focused on estimating the extent and location of these areas. In contrast, relatively few experiments have investigated the time-course of speaker identity, and in particular, dialect processing and identification by electro- or neuromagnetic means. We show here that dialect extraction occurs speaker-independently, pre-attentively and categorically. We used Standard American English and African-American English exemplars of 'Hello' in a magnetoencephalographic (MEG) Mismatch Negativity (MMN) experiment. The MMN as an automatic change detection response of the brain reflected dialect differences that were not entirely reducible to acoustic differences between the pronunciations of 'Hello'. Source analyses of the M100, an auditory evoked response to the vowels suggested additional processing in voice-selective areas whenever a dialect change was detected. These findings are not only relevant for the cognitive neuroscience of language, but also for the social sciences concerned with dialect and race perception. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Such a text-to-text model of metaphor interpretation is compatible with other NLP applications that can benefit from metaphor resolution.

Part of this intuition is influenced by the underlying metaphor, but another part is influenced by the linguistic expression which carries that metaphor. This paper puts forward a system, first, of dividing the two important elements which contribute to gradient intuitions of metaphoricity. These are (1) the density of the metaphor in the surface semantic content of the expression and (2) elements of the relationship between source and target in the underlying metaphor. Second, the paper puts forward a system for measuring the overall metaphoricity of an expression. This is a comparative system which can replicate intuitions that any two expressions have either equal or varying degrees of metaphoricity. The most interesting conclusion which can be drawn from intuitions of metaphoricity is that there are multiple factors with equal influence on metaphoricity. These factors can create conspiracies which disguise the strength of the underlying metaphor.},

We review data from on-line processing measures that support predictions of conceptual blending theory and report results of an off-line feature listing study that assessed how different sorts of contexts alter the information activated by a given word. Participants generated features for words used in the null context, sentences that promoted a literal reading of the target word, sentences that promoted a metaphorical reading, and sentences that required literal mapping. In literal mapping, the literal sense of the word was used in a way that prompts the reader to blend it with structure from a different domain. Results revealed some overlap in the features generated in each of the 4 contexts, but that some proportion of the features listed for words in literal, literal-mapping, and metaphoric-sentence contexts were unique and context specific.

All four systems are then evaluated on a common data set in order to see which premises are most successful. The goal is to see if these systems can find metaphors in a corpus that is mostly non-metaphoric without over-identifying literal and humorous utterances as metaphors. Three of the systems are distributional semantic systems, including a source-target mapping method [1â€“4]; a word abstractness measurement method [5], [6,7]; and a semantic similarity measurement method [8,9]. The fourth is a knowledge-based system which uses a domain interac- tion method based on the SUMO ontology [10, 11], implementing the hypothesis that metaphor is a product of the interactions among all of the concepts represented in an utterance [12,13].},

abstract = {While cognitive linguists have been successful at providing accounts of the stable knowledge structures (conceptual metaphors) that give rise to figurative language, and the conceptual mechanisms that manipulate these knowledge structures (conceptual blending), relatively less effort has been thus far devoted to the nature of the linguistic mechanisms involved in figurative language understanding. This paper presents a theoretical account of figurative language understanding, examining metaphor and metonymy in particular. This account is situated within the Theory of Lexical Concepts and Cognitive Models (LCCM Theory). LCCM Theory (Evans 2006, 2009b) is a cognitively realistic model of lexical representation and semantic compositionality, providing, it is argued, an account of figurative language which complements the 'backstage' cognition perspective of Conceptual Blending Theory. It also integrates the notion of conceptual metaphor within the account provided of figurative language understanding. The paper introduces the key mechanisms involved in figurative language understanding arising from language use. The paper also provides a programmatic account of how conceptual metaphors are integrated with linguistic knowledge in figurative language use. It is argued the present proposals flesh out a key aspect of the conceptual integration perspective promoted by Fauconnier and Turner, with which LCCM Theory is continuous. In part, the paper attempts to advance the prospect of a 'joined up' cognitive linguistic account of figurative language understanding},

In Spanish literary studies, there are unclear points about the types of stylistic effects that can arise, and under which linguistic conditions. To systematically gather evidence about this, we developed a system to automatically identify enjambment (and its type) in Spanish. For evaluation, we manually annotated a reference corpus covering different periods. As a scholarly corpus to apply the tool, from public HTML sources we created a diachronic corpus covering four centuries of sonnets (3750 poems), and we analyzed the occurrence of enjambment across stanzaic boundaries in different periods. Besides, we found examples that highlight limitations in current definitions of enjambment.},

abstract = {The paper discusses the incorporation of richer semantic structures into the Preference Semantics system: they are called pseudo-texts and capture something of the information expressed in one type of frame proposed by Minsky (q.v.). However, they are in a format, and subject to rules of inference, consistent with earlier accounts of this system of language analysis and understanding. Their use is discussed in connection with the phenomenon of extended use: sentences where the semantic preferences are broken. It is argued that such situations are the norm and not the exception in normal language use, and that a language understanding system must give some general treatment of them. A notion of sense projection is proposed, leading on to an alteration of semantic formulas (word sense representations) in the face of unexpected context by drawing information from the pseudo texts. A possible implementation is described, based on a new semantic parser for the Preference Semantics system, which would cope with extended use by the methods suggested and answer questions about the process of analysis itself. It is argued that this would be a good context in which to place a language understander (rather than that of question-answering about a limited area of the real world, as is normal) and, moreover, that the sense projection mechanisms suggested would provide a test-bed on which the usefulness of frames for language understanding could be realistically assessed. ?? 1978.},

abstract = {Full natural language understanding requires identifying and analyzing the meanings of metaphors, which are ubiquitous in both text and speech. Over the last thirty years, linguistic metaphors have been shown to be based on more general conceptual metaphors, partial semantic mappings between disparate conceptual domains. Though some achievements have been made in identifying linguistic metaphors over the last decade or so, little work has been done to date on automatically identifying conceptual metaphors. This paper describes research on identifying conceptual metaphors based on corpus data. Our method uses as little background knowledge as possible, to ease transfer to new languages and to mini- mize any bias introduced by the knowledge base construction process. The method relies on general heuristics for identifying linguistic metaphors and statistical clustering (guided by Wordnet) to form conceptual metaphor candidates. Human experiments show the system effectively finds meaningful conceptual metaphors.},

@article{Brooke2015,
abstract = {T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land is a notoriously challenging example of modernist poetry, mixing the independent viewpoints of over ten distinct characters without any clear demarcation of which voice is speaking when. In this work, we apply unsupervised techniques in computational stylistics to distinguish the particular styles of these voices, offering a computer's perspective on longstanding debates in literary analysis. Our work includes a model for stylistic segmentation that looks for points of maximum stylistic variation, a k-means clustering model for detecting non-contiguous speech from the same voice, and a stylistic profiling approach which makes use of lexical resources built from a much larger collection of literary texts. Evaluating using an expert interpretation, we show clear progress in distinguishing the voices of The Waste Land as compared to appropriate baselines, and we also offer quantitative evidence both for and against that particular interpretation.},

Ainsi la litt{\'{e}}rature n'est-elle plus rapport{\'{e}}e {\`{a}} un auteur qui en serait {\`{a}} l'origine, mais au langage lui-m{\^{e}}me: "c'est le langage qui parle, ce n'est pas l'auteur". L'{\'{e}}criture appara{\^{i}}t donc comme un espace neutre o{\`{u}} "la voix (de l'auteur) perd son origine", et o{\`{u}} l'{\'{e}}nonciation est con{\c{c}}ue comme "processus vide", c'est-{\`{a}}-dire comme une fonction du langage. Si le "texte moderne" implique la "mort de l'Auteur", il proc{\`{e}}de {\`{a}} la "naissance du scripteur": "le scripteur moderne na{\^{i}}t en m{\^{e}}me temps que son texte". Roland Barthes op{\`{e}}re donc un renversement o{\`{u}} le texte n'appara{\^{i}}t plus comme le produit d'un {\'{e}}crivain, mais comme un espace producteur, l'exemple le plus caract{\'{e}}ristique de cette puissance de l'{\'{e}}criture {\'{e}}tant repr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}} par ce que la linguistique a appel{\'{e}} le "performatif"; {\`{a}} la pointe de ce renversement, ce n'est plus l'oeuvre qui imite la vie, mais la vie qui imite l'oeuvre. Barthes oppose d{\`{e}}s lors, {\`{a}} l'"expression" de l'auteur manifest{\'{e}}e par la "voix", l'"inscription" du scripteur, dont la "main" "trace un champ sans origine - ou qui, du moins, n'a d'autre origine que le langage lui-m{\^{e}}me". Cette disparition de l'auteur qui s'absente dans l'{\'{e}}criture d{\'{e}}bouche sur une nouvelle conception du texte, en tant qu'"espace {\`{a}} dimension multiples, o{\`{u}} se marient et se contestent des {\'{e}}critures vari{\'{e}}es, dont aucune n'est originelle: le texte est un tissu de citations, issues des mille foyers de la culture". Le r{\^{o}}le de l'{\'{e}}crivain se borne d{\`{e}}s lors {\`{a}} "m{\^{e}}ler les {\'{e}}critures". Cette "modernit{\'{e}}" du texte implique "l'exemption du sens": "il n'y a pas de fond" {\`{a}} quoi ramener l'oeuvre. La mort de l'auteur conduit, logiquement, {\`{a}} celle du critique, d{\'{e}}sormais relay{\'{e}} par le "lecteur". Le "lecteur" repr{\'{e}}sente en effet le lieu o{\`{u}} "la multiplicit{\'{e}} du texte se rassemble": "l'unit{\'{e}} d'un texte n'est pas dans son origine, mais dans sa destination". A la fonction du Â«scripteurÂ» correspond donc celle du "lecteur", toutes deux produites par le "texte" en tant qu'espace autonome, et se substituant au couple de l'auteur et du critique.},

@article{Zipf1936,
abstract = {Frequency counts of phonemes, morphemes, and words in samples of written discourse in diverse languages are presented in support of the generalization that the more complex any speech element, the less frequently does it occur. Thus, the greater the frequency of occurrence of words, the less tends to be their average length, and the smaller also is the number of different words. The relation between frequency and number of different words is said to be expressed by the formula ab{\textless}xh:sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/xh:sup{\textgreater} = k, in which a represents the number of different words of a given frequency and b the frequency. The relationship between the magnitude of speech elements and their frequency is attributed to the operation of a "law" of linguistic change: that as the frequency of phonemes or of linguistic forms increases, their magnitude decreases. There is thus a tendency to "maintain an equilibrium" between length and frequency, and this tendency rests upon an "underlying law of economy." Human beings strive to maintain an "emotional equilibrium" between variety and repetitiveness of environmental factors and behavior. A speaker's discourse must represent a compromise between variety and repetitiveness adapted to the hearer's "tolerable limits of change in maintaining emotional equilibrium." This accounts for the maintenance of the relationship ab{\textless}xh:sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/xh:sup{\textgreater} = k; the exponent of b expresses this "rate of variegation."

Metaphor, the authors explain, is a fundamental mechanism of mind, one that allows us to use what we know about our physical and social experience to provide understanding of countless other subjects. Because such metaphors structure our most basic understandings of our experience, they are metaphors we live by---metaphors that can shape our perceptions and actions without our ever noticing them. In this updated edition of Lakoff and Johnson's influential book, the authors supply an afterword surveying how their theory of metaphor has developed within the cognitive sciences to become central to the contemporary understanding of how we think and how we express our thoughts in language.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first computationally-derived scalar mea-surement of metaphoricity. Each input sentence is given a value between 0 and 1 which represents how metaphoric that sentence is. This measure achieves a correlation of 0.450 (Pearson's R, p {\textless}0.01) with an experimental measure of metaphoricity involving human partici-pants. While far from perfect, this scalar measure of metaphoricity allows different thresholds for metaphoricity so that metaphor identification can be fitted for specific tasks and datasets. When reduced to a binary classification evaluation using the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus, the system achieves an F-Measure of 0.608, slightly lower than the comparable binary classification system's 0.638 and competitive with existing approaches.},

All four systems are then evaluated on a common data set in order to see which premises are most successful. The goal is to see if these systems can find metaphors in a corpus that is mostly non-metaphoric without over-identifying literal and humorous utterances as metaphors. Three of the systems are distributional semantic systems, including a source-target mapping method [1-4]; a word abstractness measurement method [5], [6, 7]; and a semantic similarity measurement method [8, 9]. The fourth is a knowledge-based system which uses a domain interaction method based on the SUMO ontology [10, 11], implementing the hypothesis that metaphor is a product of the interactions among all of the concepts represented in an utterance [12, 13].},

abstract = {We present a novel approach to automatic metaphor identification, that discovers both metaphorical associations and metaphorical expressions in unrestricted text. Our sys- tem first performs hierarchical graph factor- ization clustering (HGFC) of nouns and then searches the resulting graph for metaphorical connections between concepts. It then makes use of the salient features of the metaphori- cally connected clusters to identify the actual metaphorical expressions. In contrast to pre- vious work, our method is fully unsupervised. Despite this fact, it operates with an encour- aging precision (0.69) and recall (0.61). Our approach is also the first one in NLP to exploit the cognitive findings on the differences in or- ganisation of abstract and concrete concepts in the human brain.},

abstract = {Metaphor is ubiquitous in text, even in highly technical text. Correct inference about tex- tual entailment requires computers to distin- guish the literal and metaphorical senses of a word. Past work has treated this problem as a classical word sense disambiguation task. In this paper, we take a new approach, based on research in cognitive linguistics that views metaphor as a method for transferring knowl- edge froma familiar, well-understood, or con- crete domain to an unfamiliar, less understood, or more abstract domain. This view leads to the hypothesis that metaphorical word usage is correlatedwith the degree of abstractness of theword's context.We introduce an algorithm that uses this hypothesis to classify a word sense in a given context as either literal (de- notative) or metaphorical (connotative). We evaluate this algorithmwith a set of adjective- noun phrases (e.g., in dark comedy, the adjec- tive dark is used metaphorically; in dark hair, it is used literally) and with the TroFi (Trope Finder) Example Base of literal and nonliteral usage for fifty verbs. We achieve state-of-the- art performance on both datasets.},
